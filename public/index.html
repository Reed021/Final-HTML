        Look below to see some of my work as a student at Southern Connecticut
        State University. Ill even include some intimate details about me that
        im sure Google would love to sell.

            As of this moment, I'm currently halfway through my junior semester
            in SCSU. I entered the school as a freshman and was undecided on my
            major until the end of freshman year, when I declared my interest to
            persue a Computer Science Degree. My sophmore year was a sign that I
            needed to change things, my grades dipped as I realized that I loved
            the software aspects of Comp Sci, yet my hardware classes were a
            different story. Many of the aspects of hardware were not only
            diffcult for me to wrap my head around, but way and the speed at
            which they were taught made it even more challenging. At the end of
            Sophmore year I consulted my advisors with my dilema, having
            exhausted my efforts of constantly playing catchup in my hardware
            classes. with the help of my advisors I determined that above all,
            I'm passionate in finding unique ways to solve softeware problems.

            At the end of Sophmore year I consulted my advisors with my dilema,
            having exhausted my efforts of constantly playing catchup in my
            hardware classes. with the help of my advisors I determined that
            above all, I'm passionate in finding unique ways to solve softeware
            problems. For example, finding a way to keep the "About" section on
            the left responsive to different screen sizes left me stumped me for
            an hour until I stepped back and realized I could use a flexbox
            instead of vertical text to maintain proper proportions while being
            responsive to differing screen sizes. The abstract thinking aspects
            of computer science are my favorite part, and I considered this
            heavily when considered pairing Computer Science alongside History
            and Management in an Interdisciplinary (IDS) major. I have expertise
            and interest in both of these topics and each serves its own purpose
            in the type of work, or continued education I plan to persue with
            these skills.
